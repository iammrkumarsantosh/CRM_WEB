# ProHealth - Comprehensive Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System (ProHealth) project aims to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly digital platform to streamline and enhance the operations of a hospital. By incorporating multiple user login types, the system is designed to meet the specific needs of various stakeholders, including administrators, clinic receptionists, doctors, team managers, call center employees, field employees, clinic managers, backend coordinators, and accounts team members. Additionally, the system integrates features to accommodate government employees who hold Government Health Cards, ensuring compliance with government payment regulations.
