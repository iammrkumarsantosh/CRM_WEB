ProHealth - Comprehensive Hospital Management System
ABSTRACT
The Hospital Management System (ProHealth) project aims to develop a comprehensive, user-friendly digital platform to streamline and enhance the operations of a hospital. By incorporating multiple user login types, the system is designed to meet the specific needs of various stakeholders, including administrators, clinic receptionists, doctors, team managers, call center employees, field employees, clinic managers, backend coordinators, and accounts team members. Additionally, the system integrates features to accommodate government employees who hold Government Health Cards, ensuring compliance with government payment regulations.

Background and Motivation
The healthcare industry faces significant challenges in managing operations, patient data, and financial transactions efficiently. Traditional paper-based systems and disparate digital solutions often lead to fragmented workflows, data inconsistencies, and administrative bottlenecks. These inefficiencies can compromise patient care quality, delay critical medical interventions, and increase operational costs. Recognizing these challenges, the ProHealth project was conceived to provide a unified solution that leverages modern technology to optimize hospital management processes.

Objectives
The primary objectives of the ProHealth project are to:
Enhance Administrative Control: Provide super_admins with full control over the system, allowing them to manage user roles, system configurations, and compliance with healthcare regulations.
Improve Patient Interaction and Management: Equip clinic_users and clinic_managers with tools to streamline patient check-ins, appointment scheduling, and comprehensive patient management.
Optimize Medical Operations: Enable doctors to access and update patient records swiftly, facilitating timely and accurate medical interventions.
Streamline Team Management: Assist managers in overseeing team operations, utilizing reporting tools for performance tracking, and managing resources effectively.
Enhance Communication Efficiency: Provide employees, especially call center staff, with features to handle patient inquiries and appointment scheduling efficiently.
Support Field Operations: Facilitate champions, the field employees, in referring patients to clinics using a mobile application.
Ensure Data Accuracy and Integrity: Assist backend_coordinators in validating patient information and documents.
Improve Financial Management: Equip accounts_users with tools to validate and process hospital fees accurately.
Integrate Government Health Cards: Accommodate government employees with Government Health Cards, ensuring seamless payment processing and adherence to government regulations.
